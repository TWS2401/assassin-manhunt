# Assassin Hunter
A Minecraft datapack recreating the "Speedrunner vs Assassin" videos by Dream.
Hunters can kill the speedrunners in one hit, but speedrunners can freeze hunters in place just by looking at them.

Using the [Tracker Compass](https://github.com/TWS2401/tracker-compass) datapack is not required, but strongly recommended.

## Installation
- Locate your world's datapack folder
- Place the datapack into the datapack folder
- Enable the datapack with `/datapack enable "file/assassin-hunter.zip"`

## How to Use
To set the Hunters, use  
`/team join Hunters player_name`

To set the Runners, use  
`/team join Runners player_name`

(If using the Tracker Compass datapack)  
To start the game and give the Hunters their compasses, use  
`/function tracker:start`

# Assassin Hunter
A Minecraft datapack recreating the "Speedrunner vs Assassin" videos by Dream.
Using the [Tracker Compass](https://github.com/TWS2401/tracker-compass) datapack is not required, but strongly recommended.

## How to Use
To set the Hunters, use  
`/team join Hunters player`

To set the Runners, use  
`/team join Runners player`

(If using the Tracker Compass datapack)  
To start the game and give the Hunters their compasses, use  
`/function tracker:start`
